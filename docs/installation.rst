Compatibility
-------------

Tested with Python 2.7/3.3/3.4/3.5/3.6/pypy and latest version of Flask.

Should work well on most Linux and MacOS versions.

Windows is supported on paper with the full test suite running smoothly, but  the package needs some real world usage on Windows though. Please report any issues you might find to the Github issues page. Any feedback is welcome! ðŸ˜Š

Running the tests
-----------------

.. code:: sh

    git clone https://github.com/jmagnusson/Flask-Resize.git
    cd Flask-Resize
    pip install tox
    tox

Generating the docs
-------------------

.. code:: sh

    git clone https://github.com/jmagnusson/Flask-Resize.git
    cd Flask-Resize
    pip install -r requirements_docs.txt
    python manage.py docs clean build serve

Now you should be able to view the docs @ `localhost:8000 <http://localhost:8000>`_.
