Changelog
=========

1.0.3 (2017-03-17)
------------------

- **Improvement** Add image to cache when the path is found while checking for its existence, even though it wasn't in the local cache since before. This way a path can be cached even though the generation was done on another computer, or after the local cache has been cleared.

1.0.2 (2017-03-17)
------------------

- **Breaking** Removed option `RESIZE_USE_S3` and replaced it with `RESIZE_STORAGE_BACKEND`, more explicit and simple.
- **Improvement** Automatically load `RESIZE_S3_ACCESS_KEY`, `RESIZE_S3_SECRET_KEY` and `RESIZE_S3_REGION` settings using `botocore.session`, in case they are not explicitly specified.

1.0.1 (2017-03-17)
------------------

- **Improvement** Added the option `RESIZE_S3_REGION`. Can be set if the S3 region has to be specified manually for some reason.

1.0.0 (2017-03-17)
------------------

Flask-Resize 1.0  üéä  üçª  üéà  üéâ

The big changes are:

- **Feature** Support Amazon S3 as a storage backend
- **Feature** Support Redis caching. The usefulness of this is threefold:
    1. When using S3 as a storage backend to save on HTTP requests
    2. No need to check if file exists on file storage backends - perhaps noticable on servers with slow disk IO
    3. Much lower chance of multiple threads/processes trying to generate the
       same image at the same time.
- **Breaking** Please note that this release forces all generated images to be recreated because of a change in the creation of the "unique key" which is used to determine if the image has already been generated.
- **Breaking** Drop RESIZE_HASH_FILENAME as an option - always hash the cache object's filename. Less moving parts in the machinery.
- **Breaking** Rename RESIZE_CACHE_DIR to RESIZE_TARGET_DIRECTORY to better reflect what the setting does, now that we have Redis caching.
- **Breaking** Use SHA1 as default filename hashing method for less likelyhood of collision
